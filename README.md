# [Current Working] Grocery Price Tracker

## Project Overview

Nowadays, the cost of living is keep increasing because of inflation. Watching flyers from every supermarket has become our weekly routine.

However, the flyer can only tell you which products are on sale. Or which stores are offering a better price in the current week. So, what about the lowest price of a product in recent weeks or months?

If I have a systemic way to record the product price history, I can just wait for a better deal to come up and save some money on it.

And this is my idea of monitoring and finding the lowest prices for groceries.
